# QuantumOsc
A Julia module for visualizing the solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator. This repository contains a set of examples demonstrating how to use the module. It is a preliminary module currently under development to optimize runtime for eigenstates larger than 21, as it utilizes the factorial() function. In these examples, you will see step-by-step visualizations of how the module is used, presented in various Jupyter notebooks. This project was created as an academic assignment, with examples directly taken from it, and I give full credit to my professor, Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega, for this examples.

The Julia module includes comments for most functions, and their usage is generally intuitive based on the function names.
